# ðŸŽ¨ Particle Animations with HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript

## Description
This project demonstrates how to create interactive particle animations using HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. It features dynamic effects such as bouncing particles, animated constellations, and gradient backgrounds. The code is structured using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for scalability and reusability.

## Features
- **Bouncing Particles**: Particles move around the canvas, bouncing off the edges.
- **Constellation Effect**: Particles connect with lines when they are within a certain distance, forming a dynamic, constellation-like pattern.
- **Dynamic Colors**: The particles change colors smoothly using HSL values for a vibrant and visually engaging experience.
- **Canvas Gradients**: Background gradients are used to enhance the visual appeal.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the particles and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Used for implementing object-oriented structures and handling the animations.
- **CSS3**: Basic styling for the canvas.

## How It Works

- **Effect and Particle Classes:** The project uses OOP to encapsulate particle properties and behaviors. Each particle is an instance of a Particle class, and all animations are managed by an Effect class.
-**Bouncing Particles:** Particles reverse their direction when they hit the boundaries of the canvas, creating a smooth bouncing effect.
-**Constellation Effect:** As particles get close to one another, lines are drawn between them, creating a web-like structure.
-**Dynamic Colors:** Colors are assigned using HSL values and change over time for a more fluid and visually interesting experience.
